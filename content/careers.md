What is Swing Copters 2?


Dong: Swing Copters 2 is a free-to-play arcade game and a sequel of the original Swing Copters. Users control a pilot equipped with a copter-hat to fly through obstacles to get points.  
Trung: The control stays the same as it is in Swing Copters. We stick with our philosophy of the one-tap game. It’s perfect to enjoy with touchable screens on mobile devices.
