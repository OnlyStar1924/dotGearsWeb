{{< texthead >}} THANK YOU 2020 FOR ALL THE LEARNINGS AND WELCOME, 2021! {{< /texthead >}}  

The year 2020 is done and it‚Äôs time to look ahead into the new year 2021. I started as the CEO a few months before these very strange times, before the whole Covid-19 first started to affect everyone‚Äôs lives more closely. At first we thought it would be just a few weeks, and after months it became the new normal. Now our thinking is more around what it will be like after the pandemic is over, and how it has changed us ‚Äì or has it?
  

    

Something we all learned during 2020 is for sure that change is happening around us all the time. As Aristoteles has said, ‚Äúthe basic principle of all nature is the changeable and the movement; those who do not recognize them do not recognize nature.‚Äù Everything is in continuous change and movement as it is a part of nature. We need to be curious to understand that change is happening all the time and that change is inevitable.

{{< texthead >}} CURIOSITY LEADS TO LEARNING {{< /texthead >}}

One of the goals we set for the whole company in 2020 was that we need to make sure that our organization is learning from the things we do ‚Äì either from mistakes or from success. How do we learn then, and how can we create an organization that is ready for that?

First, we need to get curious. We should find the things that wake up our curiosity, but how does that happen? Remember that feeling when you get excited about something and want to learn everything about it? That is where we want to be: get everyone excited and ready to learn and be curious. We did multiple things to support all that in 2020, and it seems we are starting to see things happening and new ideas coming up constantly.

Once everyone gets curious, we might also introduce some new innovations and designs. It can be just products, but also about the company, people or systems as we are doing here I believe. How we do things, what we do and also, really importantly, what we don‚Äôt do. Design is something that is never complete. It will always remain unfinished and in a state of change, exactly like curiosity and innovation.

But what if the innovation doesn‚Äôt lead to anything good? What if we fail? We can feel scared, threatened and tuned out. We want to protect our egos, which leads to the point that we might stop learning. Should we look at it from the perspective of improvements instead of failing? We want to create an environment where, knowing this, we would get over it and actually focus on what we are doing and still be able to accept all the feelings, having no need to hide them or feel bad about it.
  

{{< texthead >}} 2021 ‚Äì HERE WE COME {{< /texthead >}}
  
    
2020 was good to us in general, even with all the challenges, and 2021 will also be a very exciting year. The things that we have been working on for several months now are finally coming together. 

The biggest change that we have done recently is in how we approach game development and how we always learn from the things we are working on as a whole company. The new game development funnel helps and directs our new game development efforts by providing a creatively free, transparent and supportive environment. There have been of course some extra challenges from remote work, but we think we have figured out how to do that, and we are also always open to improve and rethink ways of doing it better. I just can‚Äôt wait to see what our teams come up with. 
We are very proud of the excellent partnerships we have built over the years and games that have been developed in cooperation with some of them. We have also started developing the next Hill Climb Racing game and are at the same time developing totally next concepts. 

Happy to share more news when we are ready and wishing a happy new year to everyone. Super excited about the coming year and curious too, maybe even learning something along the way and being just a tiny bit better at it üôÇ
